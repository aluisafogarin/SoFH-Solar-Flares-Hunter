# Sumary

The Sun is in constant activity and some events, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejection, releases energy into space that may have repercussions on Earth and demage satellites, communication and energy transmission equipment. Thereby, is essential to have ways to predict those events in order to minimize the consequences. Some researchs uses solar images and machine learning to analyze, classify and predict active regions of the Sun in order to detect events. In order that, there is a need to have a large amount of solar images, and the process to obtain all of them can be slow and manual. Also it is common to get solar images in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) extension, being also important to convert them to other formats to viabilize the study based on image prediction.
